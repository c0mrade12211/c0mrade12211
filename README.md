### CyberSecurity Skills: 
Penetration testing (or pentesting) is the process of actively testing a system for vulnerabilities to identify and ensure security. Important skills include: 
- Understanding fundamental principles and methods of penetration testing. 
- Analyzing scan and security testing results effectively. 
- Proficiency in using various tools and programs for pentesting. 
- Awareness of ethical and legal considerations related to penetration testing. 
 
### Tools: 
Various tools and programs can be used for conducting pentests, including: 
- **Nmap:** For network scanning and device detection. 
- **Metasploit:** For developing and executing exploits. 
- **Burp Suite:** For web application testing. 
- **Wireshark:** For network traffic analysis. 
- **Aircrack-ng:** For wireless network security testing. 
- **SQLMap:** For SQL injection testing. 
- **OWASP ZAP:** For web application vulnerability detection. 
 
### Pentest Methodologies: 
Different methodologies are commonly used during penetration testing, such as: 
- **OSSTMM (Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual):** A standard set of procedures for security testing. 
- **PTES (Penetration Testing Execution Standard):** A standard describing the penetration testing process from start to finish. 
- **ISSAF (Information Systems Security Assessment Framework):** A framework for analyzing and assessing the security of information systems.
